# Fat Arrow Exercises + Intro to Node
### This was created during my time as a [Code Chrysalis](https://codechrysalis.io) Student

You have inherited an ES5 project from a legacy developer. Your job is to refactor it into ES6, making the code _as terse as possible_.

When you are finished, the tests should still pass.

## Objectives

1.  Set up a repository using a [package manager](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+a+package+manager+for+javascript)
1.  Get a hang of adding and installing dependencies
1.  Refactor crappy ES5 JavaScript to nice ES6
1.  Use tests to prevent regression during refactoring process

## Basic Requirements

1.  Initialize a package manager (either `yarn` or `node`) to create a `package.json` folder and manage your dependencies
1.  Check out the files and see if you can figure out the list of dependencies you'll need.
1.  To properly setup eslint, you will have to add the following package for it to work: `eslint`
1.  Know if they're working? Add the following to the `scripts` object of your `package.json`: `"test": "eslint . && mocha"`
1.  Fix `Car.js`
    1.  Make eslint happy
1.  Fix `Thing.js`
    1.  Make eslint happy
1.  Research: What's the difference between yarn and npm?
1.  Answer: What is a module?

## Medium Requirements

1.  What is `module`?
1.  What would this repository look like if you had to run it on the browser? What files would you keep/change?
1.  Form an opinion: Which package manager should you use? Why?
